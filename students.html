                <p>GSoC is basically an open source apprenticeship: students will be paid by
                    Google to work under the guidance of mentors from an open source community.
                    It's a really great opportunity to build new skills, make connections in your
                    community, get experience working with a larger and often distributed team,
                    learn, and, of course, get paid.</p>

                        over the course of the 3 month program.
                        This is essentially a full-time job. Ideally, you should not attempt to do
                        another internship, job, or full-time schooling while you're doing GSoC.</p>

                        Application Process
                    </h3>
                    <p>To apply, you need to <a href="index.html#ideas">take a look at the mentoring
                            organizations and the ideas that they are willing to sponsor</a>. Typically,
                        you'll choose one of their ideas and work with a mentor to create a project
                        proposal that's good for both you and your chosen open source community.
                        Sometimes, projects are open to new ideas from students, but if you propose
                        something new make especially sure that you work with a mentor to make sure
                        it's a good fit for your community. <strong>Unsolicited, undiscussed ideas are less
                            likely to get accepted.</strong></p>

                    <p>Note that Python is an "umbrella organization" which means that our team is
                        actually a group of python projects that work together to do Google Summer of
                        Code. If you're going to apply with us, you'll need to choose from one of
                        those teams, because that defines which mentors will be helping you with your
                        applications. <strong>Applications without any sub-org and mentor to
                            evaluate them will be rejected.</strong> You can work with more than one
                        sub-org while you're figuring out what you want to do.</p>
                    <p>
                        Once you've narrowed it down to a project idea or two, <a href="index.html#apply">use
                            the application checklist</a> to prepare your
                        project proposal. (You
                        <a
                            href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#can_i_submit_more_than_one_proposal">can
                            submit up to three proposals</a>, but will only be offered one position if accepted.)
                    </p>
                    <p>All applications are must be sent through the Google system.</p>

                    <p>Google intends this to be a way for new contributors to join
                        the world of open source. The students most likely to be selected are those
                        who are engaged with the community and hoping to continue their involvement
                        for more than just a few months. <strong>It's more important to be a good community
                            member than it is to be a good coder, for most projects!</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Read the instructions.</strong> A large number of students don't read the instructions
                        when submitting proposals,
                        and their applications get rejected. For example, every year we reject a number
                        of students who submitted a resume, scientific paper, presentation or other file that doesn't
                        contain any information about the project they would like to complete. Sometimes we get
                        dozens of nearly identical form letters from a single university that wind up marked as spam.
                        Don't do this!
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Listen and use feedback from others</strong>. Every year, we reject a few students who
                        simply wouldn't listen to their mentors.
                        Remember: the mentors are using their interactions with you to figure out if it's worth
                        their volunteer time to work with you. No one wants to have an intern who doesn't listen, and
                        students who don't listen also don't produce code that the open source project can use,
                        so students who don't listen don't get hired. Nor do students who are arrogant jerks,
                        or who violate the
                        <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/">Code of Conduct</a>. <strong>Be professional
                            and show that you will take the mentoring relationship seriously.</strong>

                    <p>Choosing a project is a pretty personal choice. You should choose something you want to
                        work on, and none of us can tell you exactly what that would be! But here's a few
                        questions you might want to ask yourself to help figure that out:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>What software do you already use?</strong> If you use the software, you know a lot
                            more
                            about
                            it and probably have stronger opinions about what would make it better!

                        <li><strong>What would you like to learn?</strong> GSoC is meant to be a bit of a learning
                            opportunity.
                            Have you always wanted to be more involved with biology? Astronomy? Mathematics?
                            Education? See which projects might help you improve your skills.

                        <li><strong>Who do you like working with?</strong> Hang out where the developers do and get to
                            know
                            some of
                            your potential mentors. Which developers inspire you?

                        <li><strong>How do you want to change the world?</strong> Do you want to help people learn
                            more?
                            Communicate better? Understand our world better? Lots of python projects can help you do
                            social good!

                        <li><strong>How do you like to communicate?</strong> Do you like realtime communication on IRC?
                            Perhaps you
                            should choose a project with mentors close to you in time zone. Do you like asynchronous
                            communication on mailing lists? Find a group with active lists. Communication is a big
                            part of summer of code (or really any open source development in a team) to finding a team
                            that works the way you want to work can make your summer more awesome.
                    </ul>

                    <p>There's <a href="http://python-gsoc.org/index.html#ideas">a list of sub-orgs for this year</a>

                    <p><strong>If you're chosen as a GSoC student, you're going to be expected to make some decisions
                            on
                            your own, so you can make a better first impression on mentors by showing that you're able

                    <p>The answer to this depends a lot on the project you choose. We have a range of projects,
                        from beginner to advanced. Each of the sub orgs expects different things from their
                        students: maybe you'll need to know a bit about machine learning, or email, or image
                        processing. The answer to this question is always <strong>ask your mentors what you will need
                            to
                            know for a specific project.</strong></p>

                    <p>But a lot of people ask early on because they want to be sort of generically ready but
                        they're not sure what they want to do yet, so that's not always super helpful.</p>

                    <p>So here's a list of a few things that are useful for most Python umbrella projects:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>You need to have a bit of experience with Python.</strong> You can be a
                            beginner, but
                            practicing in advance is good! And there are a lot more projects available for students
                            who are reasonably used to the language, so more practice means you'll have more
                            project
                            options.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>You need to feel comfortable asking questions</strong>, because we're going to
                            expect you to
                            ask if you don't understand something.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>You should be comfortable communicating your ideas to others in
                                public.</strong> Most projects
                            have public mailing lists and would prefer if you use them, and Python students are also
                            required to blog about their work over the summer. You can use a pseudonym (nickname)
                            if
                            that works best for you. Google will need to know who you are to pay you, but we just
                            need something to call you.<br /><br />
                            All students are required to post weekly, there are 2 types of posts students will have to
                            make, the first is the weekly check-in. For a weekly check-in every student will have to
                            answer these 3 questions in a post; with each answer being &lt;100 words.<br /><br />
                            <ul>
                                <li>1. What did you do this week?</li>
                                <li>2. What is coming up next?</li>
                                <li>3. Did you get stuck anywhere?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The second post is a blog post, here a student will be required to go into some detail on
                            what they are working on, what they struggle with, and what solutions they have come to.
                            There is no formal structure to this and every student is welcome to use their own style but
                            the above three questions should be answered in the blog post at some point.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>You probably want some experience with version control.</strong> We have a lot
                            of projects that
                            use different tools, such as git, mercurial, or bzr, and you can find out which one
                            your
                            project uses in advance and practice using it on your schoolwork or personal projects
                            to
                            get used to it.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>You might like to take a bit of time to read <a
                                    href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">the
                                    python style guide,
                                    PEP8</a>.</strong> Not every
                            project uses these rules, but they can give you a rough idea of what is considered
                            "readable code" by most pythonistas. (And for fun, you might want to read the poetry of
                            <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">PEP20 "The Zen of Python"</a>)

                <h2 class="content-head content-head is-center">How should I address my emails? (or Why shouldn't I
                    start
                    my emails with "Dear Sir"?)</h2>

                <p>If you want to make the best first impression, <strong>DO NOT start emails with "Dear
                        Sir."</strong> Python
                    has many mentors who are female and/or prefer other forms of address. We realize you're
                    trying to be polite, but "Dear Sir" is often perceived in our communities as alienating,
                    rude or simply too formal and off-putting.</p>

                <p>Try "Dear developers" or "Dear mentors" if you're sending a general email. If you're
                    addressing a specific person, use the name or nickname that they use on their emails.
                    Culturally speaking, first names or chosen nicknames are fine for most open source
                    projects.

                    <h2 class="content-head content-head-ribbon is-center">What does "don't ask to ask" mean?</h2>
                    <p>You'll hear this phrase sometimes on IRC, and it means "please just ask your question,
                        don't say something like 'can I ask a question?' first."</p>

                    <p>Why? Developers are often pretty busy, and if you just ask the question, someone can jump
                        in the minute they see your message with the answer or direct you to folk who can answer
                        it better.</p>

                    <p>If you ask "can I ask a question?" you're basically just waiting for someone to say "yes"
                        before any useful information is communicated. Many folk consider this slow, annoying, and
                        perhaps even rude. Save everyone (including yourself!) some time and just ask the question
                        right from the start. Culturally speaking, in open source projects it's generally ok
                        launch right in to a question on IRC; you don't even have to say hi first!</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Be patient.</strong> If you're on IRC, stick around for an hour or so (you can do
                            something else,
                            just leave the IRC window open and check back occasionally) and see if someone gets back
                            to you. If they don't, try posting to the mailing list (it's possible all the developers
                            are asleep!) If you're on a mailing list, you should give people around 24-48h to answer
                            before worrying too much about it.</li>

                        <li><strong>Make sure you're asking in the best place.</strong> One common mistake students
                            make is
                            to contact
                            individual developers rather than asking on a public mailing list or a public IRC channel.
                            You want as many people as possible to see your questions, so try not to be shy! (and
                            don't worry about looking too much like a newbie -- all of us were new once!) Sometimes
                            projects have different lists/irc channels/forums/bug queues for different types of
                            questions. If you're not sure, do feel free to follow up your question with something like
                            "hey, I haven't gotten an answer on this... is there somewhere better I could post it or
                            more information you need to help?"</li>

                        <li><strong>Try giving more information.</strong> If you've hit a bug, try to give the error
                            message and
                            information about your setup and information about what you've already tried. If you're
                            trying to find a bit of documentation, indicate where you've already looked. And again
                            "hey, I haven't got an answer... what other information could I provide to help debug this
                            problem?" is a reasonable follow-up if you're not sure what people might need.</li>

                        <li><strong>If you're really having trouble getting in touch with your mentors, talk to the
                                Python
                                org
                                admins by emailing gsoc-admins(at)python.org</strong> The Python org admins should have
                            contact
                            info for mentors with each project and can help connect you. (Note: please don't complain
                            that you can't get in touch with us on the general Google Summer of Code lists or #gsoc.

                            going to redirect you to Terri and the other python org admins anyhow!)

                        project
                        $x get?</h2>

                    <p>We don't know our slot allocation until Google announces them, and Google bases their
                        numbers on the number of students we tell them we want. The more great applications we
                        have, the more slots we'll request. So rather than worrying about the number of slots, you
                        should be aiming to be such a memorable and great prospective student that your sub-org
                        will definitely request a slot with you in mind. </p>

                    <p>For sub-orgs, new groups working with us usually get 1-2 slots, experienced sub-orgs may
                        be granted as many as they can comfortably mentor at the discretion of the org admins.
                        (The max number will likely be close to the total number of mentors divided by two, but
                        the actual number requested depends on which students the org specifically wants to hire
                        after they've done an initial review of the applications.)</p>

                    <p>Google has been incredibly generous with letting us have slots in previous years, so we
                        are usually more limited by the matching of mentors with truly excellent students. We've
                        had as many as 70 or fewer than 20 depending on the quality of student applications.</p>

                    <p>If we get 100 applications and 50 of them
                        are excellent, we'll try to find enough mentors for 50 students. If only 5 of them are
                        excellent,
                        then we'll be sad but we'll only request 5 slots and most of our mentors would take the year
                        off.
                        Sometimes whole sub-orgs take the year off because they have no excellent students. (and yes,
                        if every single application we got was amazing we'd try to find a way to mentor all those
                        students.)</p>

                    <p>He’s just like that! It's actually an incredibly important job: his job is to say no when
                        things aren’t ready, so we can go back and make things more awesome. It's also his job to
                        make sure that Terri's workload is reasonable, and that means saying NO pretty frequently.
                        All those no’s make it possible to run this program every year!
