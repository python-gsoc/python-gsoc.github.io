                <p>Interested in volunteering with the Python Software Foundation?</p>

                <p><strong>The biggest job is mentoring students</strong>: Mentoring a
                    student as a primary mentor can be a pretty big time commitment (see
                    "<a href="#whatmentor">What does it take to be a mentor?</a>" for more information) but it's a very
                    rewarding chance to give a student an open source apprenticeship.
                    We mentor in teams, so if all you can handle is a few code reviews or taking
                    over for a week while someone's on vacation, you can team up with someone with more time.</p>

                <p><strong>The easiest way to become a mentor is to be part of one of the sub-orgs
                        that plan to be involved</strong>, so get in touch with them directly if you want to
                    help. If you're part of a group that would like to participate as a sub-org,
                    please read the section for sub-orgs below.</p>

                <p>If you're not already part of a group
                    that wants to participate, we can try to match you with one, but be aware that to do
                    the best job of mentoring you're going to need to know the open source project pretty
                    well yourself. If you're not already a developer, you should be prepared to become
                    an active community member.
                </p>

                <p><strong>But we often need other volunteers!</strong> We're also looking for
                    friendly community members to help with other tasks! We'd love to have more
                    people available on IRC/Mailing lists to answer student and mentor
                    questions in various time zones. We are particularly looking for volunteers
                    who can read and comment on student blogs, remind students if they haven't
                    posted, and promote the work our students do to the larger Python community.
                    Or maybe you have another skillset you'd like to contribute? (Proofreading?
                    Recruiting diverse student applicants?) If you want to help, we can try to
                    find a way to make that happen.</p>

                <p><strong>If you'd like to volunteer, get in touch with a sub-org admin or
                        email the Python org admins at gsoc-admins(at)python(dot)org </strong></p>

                            Time commitment
                        </h3>
                        <p><strong>We expect around a 0-10hr/week commitment</strong>, which sounds scary, but it's not
                            actually that
                            variable. You usually spend up to lots of time for the first few weeks, where you're
                            fleshing out your ideas page, discussing projects with many students, and selecting
                            students from their proposals. After students are selected and settled in, it becomes more
                            like
                            a 1hr
                            commitment per week for a weekly meeting, and maybe a few more hours here and there for
                            code review or questions. (That depends on your student: experienced students may need
                            very little supervision, inexperienced students may need more. It also depends on you: You
                            and your co-mentor(s) select the student and project you mentor, so you can choose
                            according to the time commitment you have. Some mentors even do pair programming with
                            their students!)</p>
                        <p>I recommend at least one mentor has a <strong>weekly 1hr meeting with the student</strong>
                            so
                            they get to
                            know each other, keep everyone on track, and give a chance to talk about other stuff. Lots
                            of students have questions about jobs, courses, architecture, open source, etc. and it's
                            nice for students to have someone to talk to especially since many of them will not have
                            worked
                            remotely
                            on their own for any length of time before. Some weeks this meeting may be the only
                            mentoring
                            time
                            needed.</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>We want <strong>at least two mentors per project</strong>, so hopefully no one ever gets
                            overwhelmed and
                            feels like they're always on call (Google does ask that we try to answer questions within
                            48h so students can't get stuck for too long), and no one mentor has to know all the
                            answers.</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p><strong>Our most successful mentors are those who are already developers or community
                                members of
                                their open source project.</strong> If you're joining a new project for GSoC, expect to
                            take time
                            to learn the ropes yourself so you can help students. </p>
                        <p>Mentors don't have to be the Best At Everything. A lot of what mentors do is keep students
                            on track and keep them from getting stuck for too long. Sometimes that means just knowing
                            who to ask or where to look rather than knowing the answer yourself. </p>
                        <p>In an ideal world, at
                            least one mentor can answer at least basic architectural questions and knows how to get
                            code accepted upstream. Not every mentor has to be a coder: experienced users can help
                            students understand why features make sense (or dont!), system administrators can help
                            student
                            understand how deployment works in practice, experts in areas like accessibility,
                            usability,
                            and security could help guide students in their areas of expertise.</p>

                            Evaluating students
                        </h3>
                        <p>Mentors do have to do multiple evaluations on the student, two mid-terms and one at the end.
                            Usually the mentors discuss
                            and then the "primary" mentor fills in the evaluation with input from all mentors.
                            There's a
                            few questions about how the student is doing and then a pass/fail that determines if the
                            student gets paid and continues in the program.</p>

                            to the full GSoC period. (More is awesome!)

                                    to see if we can match you with volunteers who don't have a project.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <li>Accept the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/">Python
                                Community Code of Conduct</a> for the duration of the
                            program.

                        <li>Send an email indicating interest to gsoc-admins(at)python(dot)org before
                            the Python deadline (exceptions <em>can</em> be made if you get an amazing
                            student applicant later and want to sign up just for them).


                        <li>Have a good ideas page. <a href="#orgtemplate">We have a template below.</a> Getting a

                            sometimes takes a few rounds of revisions; We will work with you to make
                            sure your page is ready! Once you're ready for review, you can <a
                                href="https://github.com/python-gsoc/python-gsoc.github.io">send
                                a pull request to get
                                added to this page</a>

                        <li>Be able to handle <a href="deadlines.html">meeting deadlines</a> and following both Google
                            and Python's rules. We try to send important reminders for big deadlines, but we only
                            have limited volunteer time for nagging and cajoling. Groups that cause repeated problems
                            may be asked to take time off to limit core volunteer burnout.

                        <li>Disclose all potential conflicts of interest to the Python admins <b>BEFORE</b> accepting a
                            student. If you are unsure, ask. If a conflict is found after the fact the student and
                            sub-org may be dropped from the program. (Examples: student is involved in your research
                            group,
                            student is your child, student owes you money, etc.)

                        <li>Give access to any private communication channels to the PSF admins for the duration of
                            GSoC that are used for the project, ie slack, private git repo, discord etc. This is mostly
                            so we
                            can reach you where you're already looking for gsoc-related messages, but could also be used
                            if a student has a dispute with a mentor and asks for our help.

                    </ol>


                    <p>We can't promise to take everyone who meets those criteria, but we do try to
                        take any group that we feel will give the students a great experience.
                        Terri has final say in which projects participate under the Python
                        umbrella, but please send any queries to all the admins at
                        gsoc-admins(at)python(dot)org to make sure we're all on the same page.</p>

                    <p><strong>Python projects are welcome and encouraged to apply as separate
                            mentoring organizations directly with Google.</strong> We're happy to help
                        you in any way we can and we don't mind being your backup plan. We're also

                    <p>There are not very many strict requirements for Google Summer of Code Ideas pages, but
                        there are some things that students often ask us for. This page is intended as a starting
                        template for organizations so you don't forget those things.

                        <p>Warning: In 2014, many orgs got rejected because their ideas pages were offline when
                            Google checked. <strong>Make sure your ideas page is hosted somewhere that Google's Open

                                answer:
