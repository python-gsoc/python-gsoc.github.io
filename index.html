                            Python is a popular high-level programming language. It is a general-purpose language used
                            by
                            scientists, developers, and many others who want to work more quickly and integrate systems
                            more effectively.

                        Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that offers post-secondary students an
                        opportunity to be paid for contributing to an open source project over a three month period.

                        The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is an organization devoted to advancing open source
                        technology related to the Python programming language.
                        Since 2005, the Python Software Foundation has participated in Google Summer of Code, serving
                        as an "umbrella organization" to a variety of Python-related projects, as well as sponsoring
                        projects related to the development of the Python language. Python provides mentors, Google
                        provides the program (and the money!), and students write code!

                        There's hundreds of thousands of projects that use Python, and you
                        need to narrow
                        down the list before you can get help or do much that's useful.
                        See <a href="students.html#choosing">How
                            do I choose a project or sub-org?</a> for ideas
                        on how to do that.
                        <p><em>Any</em> open source experience will help you prepare for GSoC,
                            so don't worry too much about what project you try first and don't be afraid
                            to change your mind! When we know which sub-orgs will be participating,
                            they'll be listed <a href="#ideas">with the project ideas</a>.

                    <p>
                        Many projects have these tagged as "easy" "bite-size" or
                        "beginner-friendly" -- do a search to see what comes up. Competition for the easiest
                        ones can be fierce, so don't be afraid to try something harder if you think
                        you might know what to do.

                    <p>
                        Can't find a bug? Other ideas: find typos and fix them. Improve test coverage by
                        writing new tests. Improve documentation. Use a tool like Pylint or Bandit to see
                        if you can find new issues.

                                application template is available here</a>.
                            All applications <em>must</em> go through Google's application system; we can't
                            accept
                            any application
                            unless it is submitted there.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use a descriptive title and include your sub-org name in Google's system. Good
                                    example:
                                    "Mailman:
                                    Improve
                                    archive search" Bad example: "My gsoc project"
                                <li>Make it easy for your mentors to give you feedback. If you're using Google docs,
                                    enable comments and submit a "draft" (we can't see the "final" versions until
                                    applications close).
                                    If you're using a format that doesn't accept comments, make sure your email is on
                                    the
                                    document and don't forget to check for
                                    feedback!
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Submit your application to Google before the deadline.</strong> We actually
                            recommend you submit a few days early in case you have internet problems or
                            the system is down. Google does not extend this deadline, so it's best to be
                            prepared early! You can edit your application up until the system
                            closes.

                        </h3>
                        <p><strong>Communication</strong> is probably the most
                            important part of the application process. Talk to the mentors and other
                            developers, <em>listen</em> when they give you advice,
                            and demonstrate that you've understood by incorporating their feedback into
                            what you're proposing. We reject a lot of students who haven't listened to mentor
                            feedback. If your mentors tell you that a project idea won't work for them, you're
                            probably not going to get accepted unless you change it.

                        </h3>
                        An ideal application will contain 5 things:
                        <ol>
                            <li>A <strong>descriptive title</strong> including the name of the <strong>sub-org</strong>
                                you
                                want to work with
                                (if this is missing, your application may be rejected!)
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Information about you</strong>, including contact information.</li>
                            <li>Link to a <strong>code contribution</strong> you have made to your organization.
                                (Usually this is a link to a pull request.)
                            </li>
                            <li>Information about your <strong>proposed project</strong>. This should be fairly
                                detailed
                                and include
                                a timeline.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Information about other commitments</strong> that might affect your ability to
                                work
                                during the GSoC period.
                                (exams, classes, holidays, other jobs, weddings, etc.) We can work around a lot of
                                things,
                                but
                                it helps
                                to know in advance.

                        Tips!
                    </h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Read first.</strong> We've tried to answer the common questions on this site, and
                            we get asked things like "<a href="#gettingstarted">How do I get started?</a>" and
                            "<a href="students.html#easybugs">Where do I find easy bugs?</a>" a lot. Check the
                            <a href="students.html#faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on the student page</a> for
                            more!
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Be Patient!</strong> Our mentors typically have day jobs and can't always answer
                            right-away. If you can't hang out on IRC for an answer, send an email instead.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Ask questions directly on IRC.</strong> You don't need to introduce
                            yourself or say hi first, just ask away!
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Communicate in public.</strong> That lets many mentors read your question so you
                            can usually get an answer faster.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>For mentors</strong>: All the gsoc admins can be reached at
                        gsoc-admins(at)python(dot)org if you have questions about participating.
                        (Students should email gsoc-general(at)python.org with all of their
                        questions, unless they are of a sensitive personal nature.)
