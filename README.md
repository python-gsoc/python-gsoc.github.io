Python's Google Summer of Code Site
===================================

For many years, Python has used wiki.python.org to keep track of ideas pages,
FAQs, schedules, and all the plans for our participation in Google Summer of
Code. Unfortunately, editing the wiki isn't easy for everyone: it requires a
separate account, explicit edit permissions, knowledge of somewhat arcane
syntax.  As a result, the wiki pages are maintained by a very small group.
Since we had great success with moving the student blog information to
github so people could use pull requests to update it, we're going to try to
do the same with the info pages and see how it works out.
