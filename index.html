                            Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that offers post-secondary students an
                            opportunity to be paid for contributing to an open source project over a three month period.

                            The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is an organization devoted to advancing open source
                            technology related to the Python programming language.
                            Since 2005, the Python Software Foundation has participated in Google Summer of Code, serving
                            as an "umbrella organization" to a variety of Python-related projects, as well as sponsoring
                            projects related to the development of the Python language. Python provides mentors, Google
                            provides the program (and the money!), and students write code!

                            need to narrow
                            down the list before you can get help or do much that's useful.

                            Many projects have these tagged as "easy" "bite-size" or
                            "beginner-friendly" -- do a search to see what comes up. Competition for the easiest
                            ones can be fierce, so don't be afraid to try something harder if you think
                            you might know what to do.

                            Can't find a bug? Other ideas: find typos and fix them. Improve test coverage by
                            writing new tests. Improve documentation. Use a tool like Pylint or Bandit to see
                            if you can find new issues.

                                to give you all
                                the information you need to be an awesome student applicant.
                            <li><strong>Choose a sub-org</strong> (<a href="#ideas">check the list here</a>). Applications
                                not
                                associated with a sub-org typically get rejected.
                            <li><strong>Talk with your prospective mentors</strong> about what they expect of student
                                applicants and get help from them to refine your project ideas. Listening to
                                your mentors' recommendations is very important at this stage!
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare a patch for that sub-org</strong>. Usually we expect students to fix a bug
                                and
                                have made a pull
                                request (or equivalent). Your code doesn't have to be
                                accepted and merged, but it does have to be visible to the public and it does have to be
                                your
                                own work
                                (mentor help is ok, code you didn't write is not).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Write your application (with help from your mentors!)</strong> We'll have a
                                template up
                                when applications
                                open. All applications <em>must</em> go through Google's application system; we can't
                                accept
                                any application
                                unless it is submitted there.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Use a descriptive title and include your sub-org name in Google's system. Good
                                        example:
                                        "Mailman:
                                        Improve
                                        archive search" Bad example: "My gsoc project"
                                    <li>Make it easy for your mentors to give you feedback. If you're using Google docs,
                                        enable comments and submit a "draft" (we can't see the "final" versions until
                                        applications close).
                                        If you're using a format that doesn't accept comments, make sure your email is on
                                        the
                                        document and don't forget to check for
                                        feedback!
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Submit your application to Google before the deadline.</strong> We actually
                                recommend you submit a few days early in case you have internet problems or
                                the system is down. Google does not extend this deadline, so it's best to be
                                prepared early! You can edit your application up until the system
                                closes.

                            <p><strong>Communication</strong> is probably the most
                                important part of the application process. Talk to the mentors and other
                                developers, <em>listen</em> when they give you advice,
                                and demonstrate that you've understood by incorporating their feedback into
                                what you're proposing. We reject a lot of students who haven't listened to mentor
                                feedback. If your mentors tell you that a project idea won't work for them, you're
                                probably not going to get accepted unless you change it.

                            <li><strong>Read first.</strong> We've tried to answer the common questions on this site, and
                                we get asked things like "<a href="#gettingstarted">How do I get started?</a>" and
                                "<a href="students.html#easybugs">Where do I find easy bugs?</a>" a lot. Check the
                                <a href="students.html#faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on the student page</a> for
                                more!
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Be Patient!</strong> Our mentors typically have day jobs and can't always answer
                                right-away. If you can't hang out on IRC for an answer, send an email instead.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Ask questions directly on IRC.</strong> You don't need to introduce
                                yourself or say hi first, just ask away!
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Communicate in public.</strong> That lets many mentors read your question so you
                                can usually get an answer faster.
                            </li>
