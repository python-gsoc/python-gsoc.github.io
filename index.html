<h1>Google Summer of Code 2018 @ the Python Software Foundation</h1>
<img src="python-powered-h-140x182.png" alt="Python powered" height="182" width="140" />

<p><a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular high-level programming
language. It is a general-purpose language used by scientists, developers,
and many others who want to work more quickly and integrate systems more
effectively.

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> (GSoC) is
a global program that offers post-secondary students an opportunity to be
paid for contributing to an open source project over a three month period.
Since 2005, the Python Software Foundation has served as an "umbrella
organization" to a variety of Python-related projects, as well as sponsoring
projects related to the development of the Python language.

<div class="warning"><strong>It is our
intention to apply to participate in GSoC for the 2018 season.</strong>  However, we won't
know which orgs will be participating and what projects they want until February 2018, and
we won't know if we're accepted until Febuary 2018ish either.  While you're waiting, check
out our information on <a href="#gettingstarted">getting started in open source</a> -- you
can do that anytime!</div>

<p>The 2018 Python Software Foundation (PSF) GSoC coordinator is Terri Oda. (terri on Freenode IRC, terrioda
at gmail.com, but please email gsoc-admins(at)python(dot)org if you are a
mentor who wishes to
contact an admin. Students should almost always visit <a
href="#gettingstarted">Getting Started</a> first, and
email gsoc-general(at)python.org only if you get stuck.)

<p>The other org admins include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>James Lopeman (meflin on IRC)</li>
	<li>John Hawley (warthog9 on IRC)</li>
   <li>Matthew Lagoe (Botanic on IRC)</li>
</ul>

<p>We also have a great group of advisors and "org admins emeritus" who may be able
to help you:

<ul>
	<li>Florian Fuchs (florianf on IRC)</li>
	<li>Kushal Das (kushal on IRC)</li>
	<li>Stephen Turnbull (yaseppochi on IRC)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting in Touch</h2>

<ul>
<li>Please note that Python has a <a
href="https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/">Community Code of Conduct</a> and mentors and
students working with the PSF are asked to abide by it as members of the
Python community.</li>
<li>Sign up to the <a
href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc-general">gsoc-general(at)python.org</a>
mailing list to get updates, reminders, and to discuss questions.</li>

<li><a
href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=python-gsoc">#python-gsoc on
irc.freenode.net</a> is our IRC channel.  IRC is an older realtime chat protocol very
popular among open source projects, and it's worth learning to use it and getting a
dedicated client if
you're going to be involved in open source long term.  Please remember to
stick around a while for an answer, as many open source people use IRC for
work and aren't always available to respond immediately.</li>
<ul>
<li>There are some great resources at http://irchelp.org/ if you need help finding a
client or learning how to use IRC. </li>
<li>We now have a Matrix / Riot.im server, and IRC bridge.  You can make use of this
by connecting to the normal IRC channel at <strong>irc://irc.freenode.net/#python-gsoc</strong> or use
our Matrix room at 
<strong>
	<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#python-gsoc:matrix.python-gsoc.org">
		#python-gsoc:matrix.python-gsoc.org
	</a>
</strong>.
</li>
</ul>

<li>Found a typo?  Want to improve this page? <a
href="https://github.com/python-gsoc/python-gsoc.github.io">The source code
is on GitHub and we welcome pull requests!</a></li>
<li>Want to use some of the text of this page?  It is now <a
href="https://github.com/python-gsoc/python-gsoc.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE.md">licensed under CC-BY-4.0</a>.
<li>To talk with people from a specific sub-org, <a href="#ideas">check their ideas
page listing</a>.
</ul>

<p>Please try to read all the information on this page before
asking a question.  We have tried to answer a lot of common questions in
advance!</p>

<p><strong>Don't forget to be patient</strong>: Our mentors generally have day-jobs and
are not always paying attention to IRC (especially during GSoC off-season: expect more
active mentors after Google's announcement of organizations). Please ask questions
directly on channel (you don't need to introduce
yourself or say hi first) and please be patient while waiting for an answer.
You could wind up waiting an hour or much longer for "realtime" answers if all the
mentors are in meetings at work or otherwise occupied. If you can't stay that
long, stay as long as you can and then send email to the mailing list instead
so mentors have some way to reach you.  We try to answer emails within 48h.</p>

<p><strong>For mentors</strong>: All the gsoc admins can be reached at
gsoc-admins(at)python(dot)org if you have questions about participating.
(Students should email gsoc-general(at)python.org with all of their
questions, unless they are of a sensitive personal nature.)



<a name="gettingstarted"></a>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p> Here's 7 things you can do to get started in free and open source
software:

<ol type="1">
   <li><strong>Choose an organization to work with.</strong>
   <br />There's hundreds of thousands of projects that use Python, and you
need to narrow
down the list before you can get help or do much that's useful.  See <a
href="faq.html#choosing">How do I choose a project or sub-org?</a> for ideas
on how to do that.
   <ul>
		<li>Hint: Core Python development is not a great place for absolute
beginners: you probably want a smaller project with more mentorship available
as your first choice.</li>

		<li><em>Any</em> open source experience will help you prepare for GSoC,
so don't worry too much about what project you try first and don't be afraid
to change your mind!</li>

		<li>For GSoC applications, you'll need to choose from <a
href="http://python-gsoc.org/#ideas">the list of accepted sub-orgs</a> (Or
google's list of big orgs!).  If your favourite group isn't on the list,
contact them to see if they're interested in participating.  Applications not
associated with a known sub-org are usually rejected because we don't have
mentors available.

   </ul>

   <li><strong>Set up your own development environment.</strong>
	<br />Document what you do so you can remember it later, and so you can
help others if they get stuck! And if you get stuck, don't be afraid to ask
for help.

   <li><strong>Start communicating with the developers.</strong>
	<br />Join the mailing list, IRC channel, or any other communication
channels the developers use. Listen, get to know the people involved, and ask
questions.

   <ul>
		<li>In almost all cases, you should <strong>communicate in
public</strong> rather than in private. GSoC is a busy time for many
developers and many beginner questions get asked repeatedly. Help keep your
devs less stressed out by reading what they've written already and making it
easier for them to have a record of the things they've answered. You can use
a pseudonym/nickname if you want. Also, search those archives to make sure
you're not asking something that's just been asked by someone else!

      <li>If you want to make the best first impressions, <a
href="faq.html#dearsir">DO NOT start
with "Dear Sir."</a> and <a href="faq.html#ask2ask">DO NOT ask to ask</a>.

   </ul>

   <li><strong>Find some beginner-friendly bugs and try to fix them.</strong>
	<br />Many projects have these tagged as "easy" "bite-size" or
"beginner-friendly" so try searching for those terms or looking at the tags
to figure out which bugs might be good for you.

   <ul>
	 <li>Note that if you apply as a student with the PSF you will be asked to
submit a code sample, generally code related to your project. A few fixed
bugs with code accepted upstream will make your application look great!

	<li>Remember, competition for easy bugs is very high during GSoC so it can
be hard to find one that's tagged. If you don't see anything from your
search, read through the bugs and choose a few that sound like something you
can fix.  Remember to ask for help if you get stuck for too long, "I'm a new
contributor and was trying to work on bug#123456. I have a question about how
to..." -- if people can't help, sometimes they will be able to suggest
another bug which would be more beginner-suitable.

	<li>Other "easy" bug ideas: find typos and fix them.  Set up new tests --
even if the project doesn't need the first one you write, practice writing
test cases is useful for later.  Try using a tool like pylint to find issues
(but remember not everyone cares about the same things!).
</ul>

   <li><strong>Find bugs and report them.</strong>
   <br />Hopefully you won't encounter too many, but it's always a good
idea to get familiar with your project's bug reporting process.

   <li><strong>Help with documentation.</strong>
	<br />As a beginner in your project, you're going to see things that are
confusing that more experienced developers may not notice. Take advantage of
your beginner mindset and make sure to document anything you think is
missing!

   <li><strong>Help others.</strong>
	<br />This is a great idea for a lot of reasons: explaining things can
help you learn them better, demonstrating your skills as a good community
member can make you more memorable when your mentors have to choose
candidates, and being helpful makes your community a better place!

</ol>

<a name="students"></a>
<h2>Students</h2>
<p>GSoC is basically an open source apprenticeship: students will be paid by
Google to work under the guidance of mentors from an open source community.
It's a really great opportunity to build new skills, make connections in your
community, get experience working with a larger and often distributed team,
learn, and, of course, get paid.

<p>Students are expected to work around 40 hours a week on their GSoC project.
This is essentially a full-time job. Ideally, you should not attempt to do
another internship, job, or full-time schooling while you're doing GSoC.

<p>Remember that Google intends this to be a way for new contributors to join
the world of open source.  The students most likely to be selected are those
who are engaged with the community and hoping to continue their involvement
for more than just a few months.

<p>To apply, you need to <a href="#ideas">take a look at the mentoring
organizations and the ideas that they are willing to sponsor</a>. Typically,
you'll choose one of their ideas and work with a mentor to create a project
proposal that's good for both you and your chosen open source community.
Sometimes, projects are open to new ideas from students, but if you propose
something new make especially sure that you work with a mentor to make sure
it's a good fit for your community. Unsolicited, undiscussed ideas are less
likely to get accepted.

<p>Note that Python is an "umbrella organization" which means that our team is
actually a group of python projects that work together to do Google Summer of
Code. If you're going to apply with us, you'll need to choose from one of
those teams, because that defines which mentors will be helping you with your
applications.  <strong>Applications without any sub-org and mentor to
evaluate them will be rejected.</strong>  You can work with more than one
sub-org while you're figuring out what you want to do, but you can only
accept one job offer.

Here's some resources so you can read up more on how to be an awesome
student:
<ul>
<li><a
href="http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/what-is-google-summer-of-code/">The
GSoC student Guide</a> -- This is a guide written by mentors and former
students.  It covers many questions that most students ask us.  Please read
it before asking any questions on the mailing list or IRC if you can!  New
students in particular might want to read the section <a
href="http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/am-i-good-enough/">Am I
Good Enough?</a></li>

<li><a
href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/">Google's
list of resources</a> -- Note especially the <a
href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq">Frequently Asked
Questions</a> (FAQ) which does in fact answer 99% of the questions we get on
the main GSoC IRC channel.</li>

<li>Python's <a
href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/Expectations">SummerOfCode/Expectations</a> also talks about what Python in particular
is looking for in its students.</li>

<li>Python's <a
href="faq.html">Summer of Code Frequently Asked Questions</a> answers the questions that we
most often get about Python's projects. You might want to see <a
href="faq.html#choosing">How do I choose
a project or a sub-org?</a> or <a
href="faq.html#slots">How many slots does Python get?</a>
</ul>

<h3>How do I apply?</h3>

Short application checklist:
<ol>
<li>Read the links and instructions given on this page -- All of it! we've tried to give you all the
information you need to be an awesome student applicant.

<li>Choose a sub-org (<a href="#ideas">check the list here</a>).  Applications not
associated with a sub-org typically get rejected.

<li>Talk to your prospective mentors about what they expect of student
applicants and get help from them to refine your project ideas. Listening to
your mentors' recommendations is very important at this stage!</li>

<li>Prepare a patch for that sub-org</li>

<li>Set up a blog where you will keep track of your GSoC progress</li>

<li><a href="studenttemplate.html">Write your application</a> (with help from your mentors!)  Make sure to include the
sub-org name in the title so your mentors can find it in the system, and make it easy for
your mentors to comment on your doc (e.g. enable comments if you're using
google docs).  <a
href="https://github.com/python-gsoc/python-gsoc.github.io/blob/master/2018/application2018.md">A shorter
markdown version of the application template is available here.</a></li>

<li>	 Submit your application to Google before the deadline.  We actually
recommend you submit a few days early in case you have internet problems or
the system is down. Google does not extend this deadline, so it's best to be
prepared early! You can edit your application up until the system
closes.</li>
</ol>

<div class="warning"><strong>Communication</strong> is probably the most
important part of the application process. Talk to the mentors and other
developers, <em>listen</em> when they give you advice,
and demonstrate that you've understood by incorporating their feedback into
what you're proposing. We reject a lot of students who haven't listened to mentor
feedback.</div>

<a name="mentors"></a>
<h2>Mentors</h2>
<p>Interested in volunteering with the Python Software Foundation?

<p><strong>The biggest job is mentoring students</strong>: Mentoring a
student as a primary mentor can be a pretty big time commitment (we recommend
around 0-10 hours a week for the 3 months of the program, with more time at the beginning
and less once the student learns to work independently) but it's a very
rewarding chance to give a student an open source apprenticeship.
We mentor in teams, so if all you can handle is a few code reviews or taking
over for a week while someone's on vacation, we'd still love your help.

<p>The easiest way to become a mentor is to be part of one of the sub-orgs
that plan to be involved, so get in touch with them directly if you want to
help.  If you're part of a group that would like to participate as a sub-org,
please read the section for sub-orgs below.

<p><strong>But we also need other volunteers!</strong> We're also looking for
friendly community members to help with other tasks! We'd love to have more
people available on IRC/Mailing lists to answer student and mentor
questions in various time zones. We are particularly looking for volunteers
who can read and comment on student blogs, remind students if they haven't
posted, and promote the work our students do to the larger Python community.
Or maybe you have another skillset you'd like to contribute? (Proofreading?
Recruiting diverse student applicants?) If you want to help, we'd
be happy to find a way to make that happen!

<p><strong>If you'd like to volunteer, get in touch with a sub-org admin or
email the Python org admins at gsoc-admins(at)python(dot)org </strong></p>

<a name="sub-orgs"></a>
<h3>Sub-orgs</h3>
<p>To participate under the Python umbrella, a sub-org must do the following:

<ol>
<li>Be a Python-based open source project that <a
href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_a_mentoring_organization">meets Google's requirements
for GSoC</a>.

<li>Have one sub-org admin and at least two mentors who are willing to commit
to the full GSoC period. (More is awesome, though!)

<li>Accept the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/">Python
Community Code of Conduct</a> for the duration of the
program.

<li>Send an email indicating interest to gsoc-admins(at)python(dot)org before
the Python deadline (exceptions can be made if you get an amazing
student applicant later and want to sign up just for them).


<li>Have a good ideas page. <a
href="orgtemplate.html">Here's a template.</a> Getting a really great page
sometimes takes a few rounds of revisions; Meflin will work with you to make
sure your page is ready!  Once you're ready for review, you can <a
href="https://github.com/python-gsoc/python-gsoc.github.io">send a pull request to get
added to this page</a>

<li>Be able to handle <a href="#schedule">meeting deadlines</a> and following both Google
and Python's rules.  We try to send important reminders for big deadlines, but we only
have limited volunteer time for nagging and cajoling.  Groups that cause repeated problems
may be asked to take time off to limit volunteer burnout.

</ol>


<p>We can't promise to take everyone who meets those criteria, but we do try to
take any group that we feel will give the students a great experience.
Terri has final say in which projects participate under the Python
umbrella, but please send any queries to all the admins at
gsoc-admins(at)python(dot)org to make sure we're all on the same page.

<p><strong>Python projects are welcome and encouraged to apply as separate
mentoring organizations directly with Google.</strong> We're happy to help
you in any way we can and we don't mind being your backup plan. We're also
happy to help advertise python based organizations not under our umbrella: we
want students to find projects that best suit them!

<a name="ideas"></a>
<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
<div class="warning"><p><strong>GSoC 2018 is just starting!</strong> We're in
the process of getting sub-orgs set up, so more will appear through January
and February 2018 as they get in touch.</p></div>

<p>This section will contain information about sub-orgs and their project
ideas once they have gotten in touch with the PSF. It's possible some of
these groups may also apply as top-level orgs; we'll move them to a "friends
of PSF" section if that happens.  If you're unsure whether your favourite
Python-based project will be participating, ask them! </p>

<p>Not sure who might participate?  You can <a
href="faq.html#previous"</a>check out the list of all previous years
here</a>, or just <a href="2017/#ideas">check out the 2017 ideas list
here</a>.

<p>If you represent a python-based sub-org and want to be added to the list, <a
href="#sub-orgs">read up on what it takes to participate</a>, contact
gsoc-admins(at)python.org to get an ideas page review, and when it's ready
you can <a href="https://github.com/python-gsoc/python-gsoc.github.io">make a
pull request or file an issue on GitHub</a>.

<h2>Schedule</h2>

<div class="warning"><p><strong>Next Deadline</strong>
Sub-org applications due by January 19!
</p></div>

<strong>Dates</strong>
<ul>
<li>January 19 - Sub-org applications due.  <a href="http://python-gsoc.org/#sub-orgs">See
the sub-org section for details</a>.
<li>February 12 - Google Announces list of accepted mentoring organizations
</ul>

<p>Other dates and deadlines for 2018 will be set if we get accepted, so check back in
February.</p>

<p>Please note Google's <a
href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline?hl=en">GSoC
dates and deadlines</a>.

<p>In general, Python will ask mentors to do things 48h before the Google
deadline. This allows our admins time to make sure that evaluations, etc. are
complete and ready for Google when their deadline comes.  Student deadlines
remain the same, although getting things done earlier is never a bad
idea!</p>

<p>We have a Python-specific calendar here: <a
