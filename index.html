                            Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that offers new contributors over 18 an
                            opportunity to be paid for contributing to an open source project over a three month period.

                            The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is an organization devoted to advancing open source
                            technology related to the Python programming language.
                            Since 2005, the Python Software Foundation has participated in Google Summer of Code, serving
                            as an "umbrella organization" to a variety of Python-related projects, as well as sponsoring
                            projects related to the development of the Python language. Python provides mentors, Google
                            provides the program (and the money!), and GSoC contributors write code!

                            There's hundreds of thousands of projects that use Python, and you
                            need to narrow
                            down the list before you can get help or do much that's useful.
                            See <a href="contributors.html#choosing">How
                                do I choose a project or sub-org?</a> for ideas
                            on how to do that.
                            <p><em>Any</em> open source experience will help you prepare for GSoC,
                                so don't worry too much about what project you try first and don't be afraid
                                to change your mind! When we know which sub-orgs will be participating,

                            ones can be fierce, so don't be afraid to try something harder if you think
                            you might know what to do.

                            Can't find a bug? Other ideas: find typos and fix them. Improve test coverage by
                            writing new tests. Improve documentation. Use a tool like Pylint or Bandit to see
                            if you can find new issues.

                        <p>Short application checklist:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Read the links and instructions</strong> given on this site -- All of it! we've
                                tried
                                to give you all
                                the information you need to be an awesome GSoC applicant.
                            <li><strong>Choose a sub-org</strong> (<a href="/ideas.html">check the list here</a>). Applications
                                not
                                associated with a sub-org typically get rejected.
                            <li><strong>Talk with your prospective mentors</strong> about what they expect of GSoC
                                applicants and get help from them to refine your project ideas. Listening to
                                your mentors' recommendations is very important at this stage!
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare a patch for that sub-org</strong>. Usually we expect GSoC contributors to fix a bug
                                and
                                have made a pull
                                request (or equivalent). Your code doesn't have to be
                                accepted and merged, but it does have to be visible to the public and it does have to be
                                your
                                own work
                                (mentor help is ok, code you didn't write is not).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Write your application (with help from your mentors!)</strong>
                                We have an <a href="https://github.com/python-gsoc/python-gsoc.github.io/blob/master/ApplicationTemplate.md">application template</a> to help you make sure you include all the information we expect.
                                 All applications <em>must</em> go through <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google's application system</a>; we can't
                                accept
                                any application
                                unless it is submitted there.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Use a descriptive title and include your sub-org name in Google's system. Good
                                        example:
                                        "Mailman:
                                        Improve
                                        archive search" Bad example: "My gsoc project"
                                    <li>Make it easy for your mentors to give you feedback. If you're using Google docs, you can
                                        enable comments and submit a "draft" to your mentors.
                                        If you're using a format that doesn't accept comments, make sure your email is on
                                        the
                                        document and don't forget to check for
                                        feedback!
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Submit your application to Google before the deadline.</strong> We actually
                                recommend you submit a few days early in case you have internet problems or
                                the system is down. Google does not extend this deadline, so it's best to be
                                prepared early! You can edit your application up until the system
                                closes.
                            </li>

                                Tip
                            </h3>
                            <p><strong>Communication</strong> is probably the most
                                important part of the application process. Talk to the mentors and other
                                developers, <em>listen</em> when they give you advice,
                                and demonstrate that you've understood by incorporating their feedback into
                                what you're proposing. We reject a lot of applicants who haven't listened to mentor
                                feedback. If your mentors tell you that a project idea won't work for them, you're
                                probably not going to get accepted unless you change it.

                            </h3>
                            An ideal application will contain 5 things:
                            <ol>
                                <li>A <strong>descriptive title</strong> including the name of the <strong>sub-org</strong>
                                    you
                                    want to work with
                                    (if this is missing, your application may be rejected!)
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Information about you</strong>, including contact information.</li>
                                <li>Link to a <strong>code contribution</strong> you have made to your organization.
                                    (Usually this is a link to a pull request.)
                                </li>
                                <li>Information about your <strong>proposed project</strong>. This should be fairly
                                    detailed
                                    and include
                                    a timeline.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Information about other commitments</strong> that might affect your ability to
                                    work
                                    during the GSoC period.
                                    (exams, classes, holidays, other jobs, weddings, etc.) We can work around a lot of
                                    things,
                                    but
                                    it helps
                                    to know in advance.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>We also provide an <a href="https://github.com/python-gsoc/python-gsoc.github.io/blob/master/ApplicationTemplate.md">application template</a> to help you get started.

                            What do bad applications look like?
                            </h3>
                            <p>Python regularly discards about half of our the GSoC applications because they aren't valid.  Here's what most rejected applications look like:</p>
                            <ul>
                               <li>Submitted a cover letter and resume only. This isn't enough information and will land you in our "ignore" pile.</li>
                               <li>Submitted a blank file.</li>
                               <li>Submitted a random ebook or other file on your hard drive. Not only is this not a valid GSoC application, it's often copyright infringement.</li>
                               <li>Submitted your grand idea for improving Python the language.  You can read more about how to propose enhancements to python in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/">PEP-1</a>, but GSoC is not the place for that.</li>
                               <li>Project ideas not associated with a sub-org.  Often these are related to current popular topics (For example, in 2020 we got a lot of covid-tracking application proposals.)</li>
                               <li>Really simple python application ideas that are not 175 or 350 hours worth of work (For example, a python "hello world" script. Seriously.)</li>
                               <li>Random python code converted to a pdf.</li>
                               <li>A small business or personal open source project idea. GSoC is not a startup incubator, sorry. You need to apply to work with an open source project that already exists and has mentors available.</li>
                           </ul>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Read first.</strong> We've tried to answer the common questions on this site,
                                and
                                we get asked things like "<a href="#gettingstarted">How do I get started?</a>" and
                                "<a href="contributors.html#easybugs">Where do I find easy bugs?</a>" a lot. Check the
                                <a href="contributors.html#faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on the GSoC contributor page</a> for
                                more!
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Be Patient!</strong> Our mentors typically have day jobs and can't always answer
                                right-away. If you can't hang out on IRC for an answer, send an email instead.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Ask questions directly on IRC.</strong> You don't need to introduce
                                yourself or say hi first, just ask away!
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Communicate in public.</strong> That lets many mentors read your question so you
                                can usually get an answer faster.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>For mentors</strong>: All the gsoc admins can be reached at
                            gsoc-admins(at)python(dot)org if you have questions about participating.
                            (GSoC contributors should email gsoc-general(at)python.org with all of their
                            questions, unless they are of a sensitive personal nature.)
